# GameLounge-management-system

#### A Gaming Lounge is a business where customers can use a computer or any gaming device, primarily for the purpose of playing games. The use of these computers or game consoles costs a fee, usually per hour. It may or may not serve as a regular cafÃ© as well, with food and drinks being served.

#### This Gaming Lounge should have a system to track what I mentioned, so I built a software for this mission
